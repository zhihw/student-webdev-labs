# Reflection for 05-grid

---

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**

> I read the solution for grid.css 3 and @media setting for grid-areas

---

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**

> Problem 4 of grid.css was a great exercise in modifying specific elements within a grid, and entire grid-areas, but it was my first time using Media Queries.

---

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**

> For grid.css question 3, the answer seems inconsistent with the requirement, which requires item 8 to occupy 2 grids.

---

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?**

> I think that's enough.
