# Reflection for 05-grid

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**

> I can't do it alone. I'm not familiar enough with the classes in bootstrap.css at the moment, but after this exercise I'm more confident about it.

---

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**

> They are all very helpful, especially cards and modals, which are very useful elements for designing web pages. I think I will use them in my final project.

---

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**

> No, everything is explained very well.

---

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?**

> There can be more exercises on the bootstrap button class
