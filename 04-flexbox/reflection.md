# Reflection for 04-flexbox

---

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**

> I read the solution in containers 2 and 5, and completed the rest independently.

---

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**

> Each one is very helpful, especially 234, which makes me more intuitively understand the effect of reversing rows and columns, otherwise it is difficult to remember

---

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**

> Everything is fine now, no need for further explanation

---

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?**

> add some exercises where both rows and columns are reversed
