# Reflection for 03-css

---

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**

> For some style properties like display, position, box-size, I used external resources, but most of it was done by me independently.

---

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**

> I was particularly impressed by Exercise 1. Before this, I never realized that CSS selectors could be so flexible, which saved me from having to add specific classes for some special content.

---

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**

> Everything is fine.

---

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?**

> I'm still not sure how many CSS style properties there are, and maybe I'll learn more in the future, but for this exercise I think it's enough.
